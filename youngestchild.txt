-- Suggested testing environment:
-- For MS SQL:
-- https://sqliteonline.com/ with language set as MS SQL
-- For PostgreSQL:
-- https://sqliteonline.com/ with language set as PostgreSQL
-- For MySQL:
-- https://www.db-fiddle.com/ with MySQL version set to 8

-- Put the following without '--' at the top to enable foreign key support in SQLite.
-- PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON;

-- Example case create statement:
CREATE TABLE people (
  id INTEGER NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
  motherId INTEGER,
  fatherId INTEGER,
  name VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL,
  age INTEGER NOT NULL,
  FOREIGN KEY (motherId) REFERENCES people(id),
  FOREIGN KEY (fatherId) REFERENCES people(id)
);

INSERT INTO people(id, motherId, fatherId, name, age) VALUES(1, NULL, NULL, 'Adam', 50);
INSERT INTO people(id, motherId, fatherId, name, age) VALUES(2, NULL, NULL, 'Eve', 50);
INSERT INTO people(id, motherId, fatherId, name, age) VALUES(3, 2, 1, 'Cain', 30);
INSERT INTO people(id, motherId, fatherId, name, age) VALUES(4, 2, 1, 'Seth', 20);

-- Expected output (in any order):
-- name    age
-- ----------------------------
-- Adam    20
-- Eve     20

-- Explanation:
